# :warning: Maintenance Notice

According to [this comment](https://github.com/afnan007a/Ptero-vm/issues/32#issuecomment-1282276839), **Ptero-VM is no longer maintained**.

It is encouraged to use [Harbor](https://github.com/RealTriassic/Harbor) instead as it brings many improvements over Ptero-VM such as a lot smaller footprint, full `AARCH64` support and the usage of Alpine Linux instead of Debian.

You can grab the latest version of Harbor [here](https://github.com/RealTriassic/Harbor/actions).
